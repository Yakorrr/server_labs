This repository contains labs from the discipline 'Server Software Development Technologies'. Below are the instructions for running the web application on Windows and Linux platforms.

## 1. Preparation

To run the application correctly, you will need additional utilities: Python with the pip module, Git Bash, and Docker. Docker also needs a virtual machine to get up and running, therefore, it's better to additionally download and install any virtualization program (for example, VirtualBox or VMware).

Before you install Git, it's a good idea to check to see if you already have it installed. To check whether or not you have git installed, simply open a terminal window and type `git --version`.

If you donâ€™t have it installed already, follow this [link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for more instructions.

Now let's move on to Python. To simplify, I add a [link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/install-python-windows-10) with an installation guide. The installer can be downloaded from the official [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

:exclamation: **Note!** Further, you may check the *Add python.exe to PATH* check box to include the interpreter in the execution path.

Also, in the *Customize installation* section, all the checkboxes must be checked:
