This repository contains labs from the discipline 'Server Software Development Technologies'. Below are the instructions for running the web application on Windows and Linux platforms.

## 1. Preparation

To run the application correctly, you will need additional utilities: Python with the pip module, Git Bash, and Docker. Docker also needs a virtual machine to get up and running, therefore, it's better to additionally download and install any virtualization program (for example, VirtualBox or VMware).

Before you install Git, it's a good idea to check to see if you already have it installed. To check whether or not you have git installed, simply open a terminal window and type `git --version`.

If you donâ€™t have it installed already, follow this link for more instructions: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git.

After installing, you need to clone this repository to your local machine:
$ git clone
